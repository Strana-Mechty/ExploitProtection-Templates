# ExploitProtection-Templates
A set of tested profiles for Windows Exploit Protection.

This set of XMLs is meant to be an addition to the templates in the [microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/ExploitProtectionConfiguration) and [Jgregson's](https://github.com/jdgregson/Exploit-Protection-Settings) repositories.
You can also use the Settings.XML file for all the aforementioned settings.

## Known issues
Chromium-based templates suffer from a rare crash when merging tabs from different windows while a video is playing.
SumatraPDF has had hardware shadowing explicitly turned off, app crashes even in compatibility mode.
Foobar2000 will complain about not being able to spawn it's fileassociation script as a separate process, you can either disable it from running it the preferences menu or apply the mitigation after the application is set up.

## How to apply
The XML settings can be validated in powershell by doing
	
	Set-ProcessMitigation -PolicyFilePath .\discord.xml -IsValid

And subsequently applied with
	
	Set-ProcessMitigation -PolicyFilePath .\discord.xml

## Disclaimer
All templates have been carefully tested, however updates and differences in Windows build might still cause these settings to fail and cause the application to crash.
