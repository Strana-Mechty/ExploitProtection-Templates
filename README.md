# ExploitProtection-Templates
A set of tested profiles for Windows Exploit Protection.

This set of XMLs is meant to be an addition to the templates in the [microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/ExploitProtectionConfiguration) and [Jgregson's](https://github.com/jdgregson/Exploit-Protection-Settings) repositories.

## How to apply
The XML settings can be validated in powershell by doing
	
	Set-ProcessMitigation -PolicyFilePath .\discord.xml -IsValid

And subsequently applied with
	
	Set-ProcessMitigation -PolicyFilePath .\discord.xml
